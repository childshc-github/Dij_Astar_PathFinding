# Path Finding Algorithm: Dijkstra's and A* with Obstacles

***

The included files and C++ code were part of my final project for Mechanical Engineering 555 taught by Genevieve Lipp. This program is an implementation of Dijkstra's and A* search, two path-finding algorithms.

Read about Dijkstra's algorithm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
Read about the A* search algorithm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

It is also capable of finding best paths around obstacles.

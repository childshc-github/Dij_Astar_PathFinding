# Path Finding Algorithm: Dijkstra's and A* with Obstacles

The included files and C++ code were part of my final project for Mechanical Engineering 555 taught by Genevieve Lipp. This program is an implementation of Dijkstra's and A* search, two path-finding algorithms.

Read about Dijkstra's algorithm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm
Read about the A* search algorithm here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A*_search_algorithm

It is also capable of finding best paths, with either method, around obstacles.

## Quick Start
Download the mp_miniproject folder. Open in your IDE of choice and make. You can either run the path finding algorithm as described in the unit test file TESTING.txt (described below), or can setup the required files as following.

#### nodes and edges file
A node is defined as a point with a unique ID, and a (x, y) coordinate. An edge connects two points. To create your own map, setup a text file with the following format:


Other criteria:
- While the nodes do not need to be ordered, the IDs must start at 0 and be continuous (incorrect: 0, 1, 3).
-
